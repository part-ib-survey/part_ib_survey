Interesting to see that physics isn't the subject with the most interest but it is the one with the most certain people.

Describing how likely you are to choose a subject (Y) given you chose another (X). A lot to unpack but a few things stick out: chemistry at IA is done by people from all backgrounds, only one compsci answered the survey and HPS is most popular among those that do Earth, Ecology or Animal Bio. You can also see how the part IB biology subjects are grouped together.

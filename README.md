# Results of Survey of Part IB Choices for 2020 cohort

All the answers to the survey can be found [here](https://github.com/part-ib-survey/part_ib_survey/blob/master/AnonData.xlsx). Below are some figures summarizing the responses.

Describing the popularity of every subject:

Interesting to see that physics isn't the subject with the most interest but it is the one with the most certain people.

Describing how likely you are to choose a subject (Y) given you chose another (X). A lot to unpack but a few things stick out: chemistry at IA is done by people from all backgrounds, only one compsci answered the survey and HPS is most popular among those that do Earth, Ecology or Animal Bio. You can also see how the part IB biology subjects are grouped together.

Someone's choices for part IB can be represented by a vector of probabilities in 19D space. Using PCA, the dimensionality can be reduced to 2D and plotted. Not sure what the graph shows but you can definitely see some clustering of the physics and bio subjects.
